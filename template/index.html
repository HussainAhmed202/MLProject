      <h2>About Cardiovascular Risk Assessment</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">Heart Disease Predictor is a web application powered by advanced Machine Learning algorithms. This application leverages a predictive model trained on a comprehensive dataset to determine the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. Users can input various health metrics, and based on these inputs, the system will analyze the data using the trained model to predict the risk of heart disease.The codes for this project can be checked in
      <a href="https://github.com/HussainAhmed202/MLProject" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">github repo</a>
      .Our application allows users to input details such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The model processes these inputs to provide a prediction of whether the user is at risk for heart disease.
      The application utilizes a dataset consisting of diverse health indicators, allowing the model to learn the patterns and correlations that contribute to heart disease. By entering the relevant health information, users can receive an informed prediction, helping them take proactive steps towards better health management.
      Our goal with this tool is to provide valuable insights that can lead to early interventions and lifestyle adjustments, potentially reducing the incidence of heart disease. Explore our application today to take the first step towards understanding your heart health.

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p class="about-content"> Hi, I'm Vasanth, a Data Scientist üöÄ from India. 
          Currently, I'm learning ML, DL, CV & NLP. I have an experience as a Data Science Intern in a 
          company called prithvi.ai situated at Noida for around three months. Now currently I am trying
          to do some self - paced projects in data science like RainCast AI, Smart Attendance System, 
          J.A.R.V.I.S, etc.. I also have experience of taking webinars in my college. I am also trying
          to do some projects for my college too. Always curious to learn something new in
          the field of Data Science. Beside's programming, I enjoy playing games and watching youtube. 
          Below I have given my social media links. Happy to have new connections.</p>
